My name is Zoey(Zou) Yang, and I am an incoming PhD student at Dartmouth College. My research interests focus on developing machine learning and causal inference techniques to understand human behavior, improve decision-making, and address algorithmic bias, with a special interest in health-related societal challenges. Before moving to Boston, I spent two years working as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst at a tech company and AI startups. I hold an MS from Cornell University and Boston University and a BA from Rutgers University.

I am joining <a href="https://bijanmazaheri.com/"> Professor Bijan Mazaheri's lab</a> to continue studying the intersection of machine learning and causal inference. 
I am fortunate to be part of <a href="https://truthmarket.com/">Platform Governance Research Lab</a>, advised by <a href="https://truthmarket.com/people/mva/index.html">Professor Van Alstyne</a> from BU. I am also privileged to collaborate with <a href="https://www.aeghassami.com/">Professor Ghassami</a> from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics and <a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/julia-r-koehler">Professor Köhler</a> from Boston Children's Hospital to address community health issues using Causal Inference. 


[**Research Interest**]
1. *Data Fusion and Inference.* One of the complexities in social science arises from the involvement of different covariates across various domains. How can we integrate data from different distributions to improve inference?
2. *AI + social science/public health.* How can we leverage AI to promote health equity and gain deeper insights into human behavior? How can insights from human cognition help us design better AI systems?
